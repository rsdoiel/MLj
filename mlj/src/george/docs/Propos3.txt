Replacement of new
==================

(27th June 1997)

The new constructor in the basic blocks signature will be replaced by another:

val new:Descriptors.method_ref -> operation

This is to correspond with the Java language form new(args).  The method reference should be to
an init method, which must (as required by the VM) return void.  The effect of new(method) will be
to create a new object of type (class of method), call method with args (new object::input list for
operation).  The output list for the operation should contain one value, which corresponds with the
new object.

The object is currently guaranteed not to be stored in a local variable before the method has been
called, to comply with certain incorrect verifiers.  

NB.  I am also preparing proposals to replace field and method references by FieldHandle.Handle and
MethodHandle.Handle objects, where as with ClassHandle Andrew can use his privileged position to provide
me with extra information; EG whether a function is pure.  This will affect new again, since its type will
change to
val new:MethodHandle.Handle -> operation
