INSTALLING MLJ 0.2
------------------

These instructions are the absolute minimum for setting up MLJ. For
more details see the MLJ User Guide in mlj/doc/mlj.dvi.

In your user profile make the following changes:

(1) Set MLJBIN to the absolute path name of the directory mlj/bin 
that (will) contain the executables.

(2) Extend your PATH with this directory.

(3) Set BOOTCLASSPATH to a path in which the Java system classes live.
For Sun's JDK prior to version 1.2, these are collected together in a single
file called classes.zip in a directory called lib. For JDK 1.2, they probably
live in a file rt.jar in a directory jre/lib. For Microsoft's SDK you may need
to use the CLSPACK utility program to create a classes.zip file.

(4) If you downloaded the pre-built binaries, that's it! Otherwise, you must
have a copy of SML/NJ installed (for Windows, invoked by sml-cm; for Unix 
systems, simply by sml) with the CM_PATH environment variable set properly
(e.g. to /sml/lib). In the directory mlj type 

  build

Assuming everything works as expected, an SML/NJ image file should be stored 
in mlj/bin, and the SML/NJ runtime copied across so that upgrades to your 
SML/NJ installation don't disrupt MLJ.
