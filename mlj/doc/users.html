<h1 align=center>MLj mailing list</h1>
<hr>

For queries about installing or using the compiler, send mail to <a
href="mailto:mlj@dcs.ed.ac.uk">mlj@dcs.ed.ac.uk</a>.  This is circulated to
the authors and maintainers of MLj.

<p> There is also a discussion list <strong>mlj-users</strong> for anyone
interested in the compiler.  This is managed automatically by the <a
href="http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/">Majordomo</a> package, with an <a
href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mlj/mailarc/threads.html">archive of
messages</a> generated automatically by <a
href="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html">MHonArc</a>.

<h3>To join the list</h3>

<p> Send an email message to <a
href="mailto:majordomo@dcs.ed.ac.uk">majordomo@dcs.ed.ac.uk</a> with the line
</p>
<blockquote>
	subscribe mlj-users
</blockquote> 
<p>
in the body.  This will add you to the mailing list, at the address from which
you sent the message.  Alternatively, you can tell Majordomo  that you want to 
subscribe at a different address by putting
</p>
<blockquote>
	subscribe mlj-users your-address@somewhere.else
</blockquote>
<p>
in the body of your message.  To avoid people being added to the list without
their knowledge, Majordomo may send email asking for confirmation.
</p>


<h3>To post to the list</h3>

<p>Send your message to <a
href="mailto:mlj-users@dcs.ed.ac.uk">mlj-users@dcs.ed.ac.uk</a>.  The list is
not moderated, but messages over ten thousand characters will be redirected to
the list owner.  All messages have a one-line notice attached that points to
this web page.


<h3>To leave the list</h3>

<p> Send an email message to <a
href="mailto:majordomo@dcs.ed.ac.uk">majordomo@dcs.ed.ac.uk</a> with the line
</p><blockquote>
	unsubscribe mlj-users
</blockquote><p>
in the body.  This will remove the address from which you sent the message.
If you are subscribed with some other address, you have to tell Majordomo
this by putting
</p><blockquote>
	unsubscribe mlj-users your-address@somewhere.else
</blockquote><p>
in the body of your email.  If you don't know what address you are subscribed
with, you can send the following command
</p><blockquote>
	who mlj-users
</blockquote><p>
and Majordomo will reply with list of all the addresses on the mailing list.
</p>
