<h1>Standard ML</h1>
</center>

<HR>
<p>
Standard ML is a safe, modular, strict, functional, polymorphic
programming language with compile-time type checking
and type inference,
garbage collection, exception handling,
immutable data types and updatable references,
abstract data types, and parametric modules.  
It has efficient implementations and a formal definition
with a proof of soundness.
<p>
ML is used in teaching, research and industry around the world
in applications ranging from compilers and theorem provers to web
browsers, toolkits for distributed computation and low-level system programming.
<p>
There are now plenty of books, guides, manuals and lecture notes
describing the Standard ML language. Here are some pointers to get you
	started:
<ul>
<li>Bob Harper's <A HREF="http://foxnet.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/rwh/public/www/introsml">Introduction
to Standard ML</A><p>
</li>
<li>Andrew Cumming's <a href="http://www.dcs.napier.ac.uk/course-notes/sml/manual.html">
Gentle Introduction to ML</a> (<a
href="http://fas.sfu.ca/cs/LocalDoc/Software/ML/giml/manual.html">mirrored
in Canada</a>)<p>
</li>
<li>Mads Tofte's <cite>Four Lectures on Standard ML</cite>: 
<a href="ftp://ftp.diku.dk/pub/diku/users/tofte/FourLectures/D-112-part1.dvi">Part 1</a>,
<a href="ftp://ftp.diku.dk/pub/diku/users/tofte/FourLectures/D-112-part2.dvi">part 2</a>, and
<a href="ftp://ftp.diku.dk/pub/diku/users/tofte/FourLectures/D-112-part3.dvi">part 3</a>.
(<a href="ftp://ftp.diku.dk/pub/diku/users/tofte/FourLectures/sml">Examples 
from the paper</a> are available online.)<p>
</li>
<li>Larry Paulson's <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/MLbook/"><I>ML
for the Working Programmer</I></A><p>
</li>
</ul>
Paulson's book is particularly recommended.

<h3>Other Implementations of ML</h3> 

The following are the other main implementations of Standard ML,
though there are also a number of research implementations. The web
pages for these projects are also all valuable sources of other
ML-related links.

<h3>The Definition</h3>

The formal semantics of the language is defined in 

<ul><li> <A
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262631814"><i>The
Definition of Standard ML (Revised)</i></A> by Robin Milner, Mads
	  Tofte, Robert Harper and David MacQueen</li></ul>

but be warned that it's not a particularly light read! The definition
specifies formally not just the grammar of SML, but also the meaning
of the language. SML is the only "realistic" language which has been
specified so precisely.  <p> 

The original Definition was published in 1990. The revised Definition,
published in 1997, makes a number of changes which simplify some
aspects of the language and increase the expressiveness of others.
Roughly concurrently with the changes to the language itself, a new <a
href="http://www.dina.kvl.dk/%7Esestoft/sml/sml-std-basis.html">Standard
Basis Library</a> was defined. This is a collection of ML structures
which implement the types and functions necessary for common
day-to-day programming tasks. The new language is often referred to as
SML'97.

<h3>Newsgroups</h3>
Two newsgroups are of interest:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="news:comp.lang.ml">comp.lang.ml</a> with <a href="ftp://pop.cs.cmu.edu/usr/rowan/sml-archive/faq.txt">FAQ</a> discusses
the Standard ML language and its French cousin CAML.
<li>
<a href="news:comp.lang.functional">comp.lang.functional</a> 
discusses functional programming in general.
</ul>
