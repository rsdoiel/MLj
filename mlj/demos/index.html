<h1>MLj Examples</h1>
</center>
<HR>
This page contains links to some examples of the use of MLj. Most of
these include applets written in MLj or which mix MLj and Java code,
so you'll need a browser which supports Java to appreciate them. The 
way the examples are presented here at the moment, that means Netscape 3 
or higher, or Internet Explorer 4. (Internet Explorer 3 could run these 
examples if the class files were unarchived, but downloads would be 
horribly slow in that case.)
<p>
Before running these demos in a browser please make sure that 
your CLASSPATH environment variable does not contain 
classes that might conflict.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="queens/index.html">Eight Queens</a>.

<li>

An applet that lays out trees automatically.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/MLbook/"><I>ML 
for the Working Programmer</I></A>. NOTE: this is a fairly large applet (about 100K) and crashes at least one old browser (Navigator 3.0 on Digital Alpha OSF/1).<p>
