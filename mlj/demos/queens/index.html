<h1>Eight Queens Example</h1>
</center>
<HR>
A standard introductory programming exercise, given a new look.

<applet archive="AQueensApplet.zip" code="Queens.class" width=420 height=420>

<h3>The code</h3>
The code for this example is partially taken from <A href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp">Larry Paulson</a>'s book <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/MLbook/"><I>ML 
for the Working Programmer</I></A> (Second Edition), published by Cambridge University Press, 1996. Those parts are subject to the following <a href="LICENCE-CUP">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty</a>. <p>

The structure <A href="AQueens.sml">AQueens</a> computes a circular lazy stream of solutions to the problem using a general depth-first search. For each adjacent pair of solutions, another search enumerates the legal ways of moving the queens from one solution to the next and picks an `interesting' one (in this case, the one with the most diagonal moves, but that's easily tweaked).
<p>
The second part of the applet is the structure <a
href="AQueensApplet.sml">AQueensApplet</a> which declares the applet
and sets up a concurrent thread which actually does the
animation. This is fairly imperative code and makes heavy use of MLj's
Java extensions -- it was based on an MLj
transcription of some code from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javanut2/">Java in a Nutshell</a> by David Flanagan.
