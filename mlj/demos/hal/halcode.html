<h1>The structure of the Hal applet</h1>
</center>
<HR>
The Hal applet is an interesting example of the use of MLj's
interlanguage working extensions and the way in which MLj applications
can benefit from the large amount of useful Java code now available
over the web. Most of the code is the same as that in Larry Paulson's
book except that it had to be defunctorised to go through MLj. The
orginal Hal program does not, however, contain any user interface code
- it just defines a collection of values and functions which are
intended to be called from within the top-level interactive
read-eval-print loop of an executing ML system.  MLj doesn't have such
a loop (and even if it did, downloading a complete ML environment into
a browser would be somewhat impractical).
<p>
So, to compile a stand-alone version of Hal, we first have to write
some code which accepts, parses and executes commands from the
user. Returning results doesn't require so much work, since Hal
already pretty-prints most of those explicitly, rather than just
returning ML values for the top-level loop to print. But Hal commands
are often non-trivial ML expressions, involving the application of
higher-order functions (tacticals), which means that our command
interpreter should itself understand a small functional language. (Of
course, ML itself was originally developed for just this purpose!) 
<p>

To keep things simple, we made the command language be an untyped
combinatory (variable-free) calculus, for which it is easy to write an
interpreter which calls into the appropriate functions from original
Hal code. The parser uses the same general-purpose parser combinators
as are already used in Hal for parsing logical formulae and so only
took a few minutes to write. The interpreter was also easy to write -
its core is only a dozen or so lines of ML. The parser and interpreter
can be found in the <a
href="ServerInterpret.sml"><tt>ServerInterpret</tt></a> structure.

<p>

That's all fairly straightforward, and is all one needs to do to
produce a version of Hal which can be compiled by MLj and run as a
stand-alone Java <i>application</i> from the command line. Input is read from
<tt>stdIn</tt> and then parsed and evaluated using the interpreter, which calls
the core Hal functions which print results to
<tt>stdOut</tt>. Unfortunately, producing an <i>applet</i> which will run in
a browser requires a bit more work. When an applet is running,
<tt>stdOut</tt> goes to the browser's Java console window rather than
to the page displaying the applet and there's no <tt>stdIn</tt>
provided at all - Java applets each have their own graphical user
interface, written using Java's Abstract Windowing Toolkit
(AWT). Whilst it would be an interesting and worthwhile project to
write a full graphical front-end to Hal, we decided to start by
providing a traditional textual interface in a browser window. Even
that, however, appears to involve writing a significant amount of
user-interface code to emulate a traditional terminal window: reading
keypresses, writing to the screen, dealing with the delete key,
scrolling the window and so on. Writing all that using MLj's Java
extensions would be easy, but dull. Instead, we did a quick web search
for terminal emulator applets written in Java, as these should already
contain appropriate screen and keyboard management code. We chose
<a
href="http://www.nacse.org/web/webterm2.0/">WebTerm</a>, 
which was written by Dianne Hackborn and Melanie Johnson at
the  <a
href="http://www.nacse.org">Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and
Engineering</a>. By
stripping out the parts dealing with network connections and the
emulation of particular terminals, we were left with about 800 lines
of Java code which did what we wanted.

<p>

We then had to decide how to interface the Java and ML parts to create
our applet. The problem here is that the communication is
bidirectional and imperative: the Java code has to collect characters
and send them to the ML code for evaluation and the output of the ML
code (which is produced by side-effecting printing) has to be fed back
to the Java window. Even in a simple case, this kind of bidirectional
communication requires a little care -- one cannot just have the
Java code refer to a class exported from the ML code <i>and</i> have
the ML code refer to an application-specific class in the Java code
because each would then require the other to have been compiled first.

<p>

The solution to the cyclic dependency which we adopted for Hal was to
make the ML code export two classes. The first of these is
<tt>HalServer.HalServer</tt> which looks like this:
<pre>
_public _classtype HalServer  {
 _public _static _synchronized _method 
    processline (arg : string option) : Threads.Thread option =
 SOME (Threads.new (fn _ => (ServerInterpret.toplevel (valOf arg)))

 _public _static _synchronized _method 
    registerReader (aReader : Schan.SchanReader option) =
       (Schan.theReader := aReader)
}
</pre>

Ignoring all the threading stuff, this basically presents two methods
to the Java code, <tt>processline</tt> and
<tt>registerReader</tt>. The first of these is simply called by the
Java part of the applet when
it has a string to be handed over to the top-level parser and
interpreter. The second is used to set up a channel from the ML to the
Java by which strings can be printed in the terminal window.

<p>

The structure <tt>Schan</tt> defines the second class exported by ML:
<pre>
structure Schan = 
struct

_public _interfacetype SchanReader {
 _public _abstract _method handlechan (arg: string option)
}

val theReader = ref(NONE) : SchanReader option ref

fun write s = case !theReader of 
               SOME(v) => v.#handlechan (s:string)
             | NONE => ()
end
</pre>

This declares a Java interface <tt>SchanReader</tt> which contains a
single method <tt>void handlechan(String)</tt>. The Java code includes
a class which (a) registers itself with the ML code by calling the
<tt>registerReader</tt> method in <tt>HalServer</tt>, and (b)
implements the <tt>SchanReader</tt> interface with a method which prints its
argument in the terminal window:
<pre>
public class Toplevel extends Applet implements SchanReader {
  Terminal myterminal;
  ...
  HalServer.registerReader(this);
  ...
  public void handlechan (String thedata) {
    myterminal.write(thedata, 0);
  }
</pre>

When the ML code needs to print, it calls <tt>Schan.write()</tt> which
looks for a registered reader (in the <tt>ref</tt> cell
<tt>theReader}</tt>, and if it finds one, calls its
<tt>handlechan</tt> method.

All of that means that the ML code can be compiled first, without
needing to know about the Java part. The Java can then be
compiled against the class files generated from the ML compilation:
<pre>
% mlj
MLj 0.2 on x86 under Win32 with basis library for JDK 1.1
Copyright (C) 1999 Persimmon IT Inc.

MLj comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. It is free software, and you are

\ sourcepath +../conc
\ export HalServer.HalServer HalServer, Schan.SchanReader SchanReader
\ make
 ...
Compilation completed.
\ quit
% javac -classpath HalServer.zip Toplevel.java
%
</pre>
The reason that we had to specify the <tt>sourcepath</tt> in the
compilation of this example is that the <tt>HalServer</tt> class also
makes use of a structure <tt>Threads</tt> from
<tt>demos/conc</tt> which provides a trivial ML wrapper
around Java's ability to create and destroy new concurrent threads.

<p>

The Hal demo takes advantage of Java's built-in concurrency to do the
ML computation in a different thread from the user interface. This
allows the user to interrupt a long (or non-terminating) computation
just by pressing a key. If you look again at the code above for
<tt>HalServer.processline</tt>, you'll see that it spawns a new thread
to parse and execute the user command and immediately returns the
generated thread object to the calling Java code, where it is stored
in an instance variable of the terminal. The Java code for
handling keypress events looks at that variable, and if there's a
currently executing process it is stopped before the key is pressed:
<pre>
if (computeThread != null && computeThread.isAlive()) {
      computeThread.stop();
      computeThread = null;
      write("**interrupted**\n",0);
   }
</pre>

Similar code is executed when the applet's <tt>stop</tt> method is
called, so that a long-running computation is terminated when the user
leaves the page containing the applet.

<p>

This sort of use of Java concurrency in MLj programs is rather crude,
and should really be replaced by a more well-designed collection of
functional conncurrency primitives. For the moment, however, it's
worth noting that MLj does let you write concurrent ML programs and
that this is often very useful.
