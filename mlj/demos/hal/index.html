<h1>Hal: A Tactical Theorem Prover</h1>

The core of this example was written by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/">Larry Paulson</a> and is described in Chapter 10 of his (highly recommended) book <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/MLbook/">ML for the Working Programmer</a>.

This applet implements an interactive tactical theorem prover for
first-order logic. It combines Larry Paulson's original ML code with
an ML parser for interpreting commands and a scrolling terminal window
written in Java. The terminal code was adapted from the <a
href="http://www.nacse.org/web/webterm2.0/">WebTerm</a> applet written
by Dianne Hackborn and Melanie Johnson at the <a
href="http://www.nacse.org">Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and
Engineering</a>.
